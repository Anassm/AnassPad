Key Issue Encountered During Development
----------------------------------------

Setback Summary:
While developing the key press logic, I encountered a significant issue that 
cost almost a full day to debug. The hall sensors require properly calibrated 
minimum and maximum values to convert keypresses into percentages (from 0 to 
100% in this case). However, I noticed that the minimum value was unexpectedly 
low, which prevented the system from recalibrating to a more accurate value 
since the `current value` would never drop to this low threshold.

Root Cause:
After extensive debugging, I identified the root cause: the minimum value was 
being set using a filtered value from the hall sensor, calculated with a Simple 
Moving Average (SMA). During the very first cycle of the SMA, the buffer was 
empty and had no initial values. Since the buffer size was 4, it initially 
processed values like: 
    [0, 0, <higher value>, <even higher value>]
The average of these values was skewed lower due to the two zeros, setting the 
minimum value to around 540â€”much lower than expected and out of range for the 
`current value` to reach.

Impact:
This incorrect minimum value caused the calculated percentage values to hover 
around 82% even when no keys were pressed, which was inaccurate and confusing.
